Statistics_NBA_Regression

In this project I made conduct a statistical research on the NBA draft data based on the college basketball statistics of the players. Basically, I tried to predict the draft order for this year.

You will find a dataset in the link given below. I calculated the correlation coefficients between the variables then I built a regression model to make predictions for the next year.
